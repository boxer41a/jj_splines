# jj_splines
Class to demo and test the feasibility of using Eiffel without dependencies of other libraries, in this case to simply calculate cubic spline given control points.

The CUBIC_SPLINE class attempts to implement the algorithm found at [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mathematics)).

The program outputs two files:  1) control_points.txt that contains the control points and 2) points.txt that shows the output points.  Use a graphing program to display a plot of the points.


Note that something is wrong with the calculation, so I need help form and Eiffel programmer.
